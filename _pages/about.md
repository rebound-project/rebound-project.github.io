In the Rebound project we develop computational methods for analyzing data on news dissemination and discussions in online media. The objective is to obtain a deeper understanding on phenomena related to bias, polarization, and information bottlenecks in online media. We develop methods to discover structure and patterns of segregation, conflict, and closeness in social-media systems. We also address the issues of reducing bias and polarization, breaking information silos, and creating awareness of users to explore alternative viewpoints.

The Rebound project is funded by the [European Research Council (ERC)](https://erc.europa.eu), grant number 834862.
